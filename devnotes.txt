To use the require keyword in TS: <START>

If you are using Webpack as your build tool you can include the Webpack types.

npm install --save-dev @types/webpack-env

Update your tsconfig.json with the following under compilerOptions:

"types": [
      "webpack-env"
    ]
This allows you to do require.ensure and other Webpack specific functions.
